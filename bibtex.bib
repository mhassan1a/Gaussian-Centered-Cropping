    abstract = {In the contemporary computer vision and deep learning landscape, 
    contrastive learning (CL) stands out as one of the most important self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks. 
    CL offers the advantage of learning directly from unlabeled data by leveraging fundamental knowledge representation principles,
    thereby enabling the acquisition of meaningful representations that are transferable to downstream tasks.
    However, the success of CL methods is highly dependent on the effective use of robust image augmentation techniques,
    particularly random cropping. CL methods utilize random cropping to produce similar and semantically related views, termed positive pairs.
    By contrasting these views with one another, these methods aim to learn and capture representative features of the classes. 
    However, random cropping can also introduce false positives, where views from different classes are incorrectly treated as positive pairs,
    leading to a significant degradation in performance. Consequently, the primary challenge associated with the stochastic generation
    of crops lies in striking a balance between introducing non-trivial positive pairs and minimizing the occurrence of false positives.
    To tackle this challenge, this project proposes a novel approach: a parameterized cropping method, Gaussian Centered Cropping (GCC), 
    that facilitates hyper-tuning of the cropping process, thereby reducing the occurrence of false positives. 
    The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional random cropping
    by 2.7, 6.7, 9.5, and 12.4 percentage points for crop sizes of 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, and 80\% respectively,
    at the same computational cost. In addition, an enhanced version of GCC, Multi-object Gaussian Centered Cropping (MGCC),
    is presented to handle images containing multiple objects, further reducing the likelihood of false positives.},
